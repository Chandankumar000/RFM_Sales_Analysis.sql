RFM Sales Analysis Useing Sql and Tableau

# What is RFM ?
> RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.
Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis is a indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers.
 Given a table with purchase transaction data, we calculate a score based on 
 1. How recently the customer purchased ?
 2. How often they make purchases ?
 3. How much they spend in dollars on average on each purchase.?
 
Using these scores, we can segment our customer list to:
 identify our most loyal customers by segmenting one-time buyers from customers with repeat purchases
increase customer retention and lifetime value
increase average order size, etc.
