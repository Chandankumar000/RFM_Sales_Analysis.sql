# What is RFM ?
> RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.
>>  Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis is a indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers.
 Given a table with purchase transaction data, we calculate a score based on 
 how recently the customer purchased, 
 how often they make purchases and 
 how much they spend in dollars on average on each purchase. 
 Using these scores, we can segment our customer list to:

increase customer retention and lifetime value
increase average order size, etc.
